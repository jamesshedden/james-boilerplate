jsbp: James' front-end boilerplate
==================================

I wanted to play with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and I also wanted to better understand how to implement a decently-organised [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) setup within a build tool. These helped a lot:

- http://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp
- http://mindthecode.com/lets-build-an-angularjs-app-with-browserify-and-gulp/

Ultimately it would probably be easier and safer to use something like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), but where's the fun in that?

### Running locally

First, install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) if you don't have it already:

```
$ npm install -g gulp
```
(You might need to run `$ sudo npm install -g gulp` if that doesn't work)

Next:

```
$ npm install
$ gulp start
```

This will build your app and start watching for changes at `http://localhost:5000` (which will be launched in your default browser after running `$ gulp start`).

Any changes to HTML, SCSS & JS will cause open browser sessions to reload.

### Stuff that happens

####HTML

- `app/pages/index.html` is the app's index page
- Folders can be added within `app/pages/` eg `app/pages/your-section-name/index.html`

Gulp sends your HTML into `build/` eg `build/index.html` and `build/your-section-name/index.html` (which you could visit at `http://localhost:5000/` and `http://localhost:5000/your-section-name/` respectively)

####CSS

- `app/css/` for all your SCSS
- `app/css/components/` for individual components or modules
- `app/css/shared/` for your most general rules (eg normalize.css, basic rules for html, body, etc)
- `app/css/utils/` for utilities (Ã  la https://github.com/suitcss/utils)
- `app/css/variables.scss` for all your SASS variables
- `app/css/mixins/` for your SASS mixins

Any new components, shared or utils files you create must be imported within `app/css/main.scss`, which is the file Gulp processes to create your final stylesheet at `build/assets/css/main.css`.

Don't forget `@import 'variables';` at the top of any new files that include variables - and `@import 'mixins/your-mixin-name';` in any new files where you've used `@include your-mixin-name`, and so on.

####JS

`app/js/` -> `build/assets/app.js`

Instructions coming soon! Angular setup needs a bit more work.
